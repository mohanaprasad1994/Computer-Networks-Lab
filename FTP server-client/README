FTP Client and Server on top of TCP sockets

You can use any port to run.
./ server 9999
./client 9999 127.0.0.1

commands supported : cd,lcd,pwd,ls,get,put
cd ~,cd / are all handled
$ pwd returns present working directory of server ( from the virtual root) and  the current working directory of client
$ get /SD1/a will get that file and paste it in the current working directory of client


Typescript gives further instructions for running and testing the code
