Mr. Modi was not expected to meet Mr. Obama at the airport but changed his mind at the last moment, according to India’s foreign ministry.

Mr. Obama is on an official three-day visit to India where he will be chief guest at India’s Republic Day parade on Monday.

Mr. Modi paired his statement shawl with a cream-colored long shirt and sleeveless vest with a stiff Roman-collar, sometimes called the Modi vest. The final flourish was the saffron shawl.

This is not the first time the vibrant shawl has made an appearance. Mr. Modi wore it during his official visit to Nepal in May, pairing it with a saffron shirt during a prayer session at the Pashupatinath temple in the capital city of Katmandu.
