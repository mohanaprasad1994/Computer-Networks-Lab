U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit to India began with a pair of style statements.

It was not Mr. Obama who sent a sartorial message, but his wife First Lady Michelle Obama and his host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Few men wear paisley as well as Mr. Modi who donned a saffron-colored shawl embroidered with the teardrop pattern when he greeted Mr. Obama on a windy winter morning at New Delhi’s Palam air force base.
