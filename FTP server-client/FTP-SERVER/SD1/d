Just as it stood out then, the shawl stands out now.

In photos from a drab Sunday at Palam airport, the bright shawl was the only splash of color on a grey and foggy morning that stood out drawing one’s eye to the host premier and away from the guests, in spite of the First Lady’s dress.

Never to shy away from color Mrs. Obama showcased the work of one of her favorite Indian-American designers, wearing a tailored dress and matching jacket, printed with splashes of black, white and blue–by Indian-born designer Bibhu Mohapatra.

Mr. Mohapatra’s office tweeted about the dress as soon as the first images of Mrs. Obama arriving in India appeared on television.
