Implemented Selective repeat protocol over UDP. Selective ack was used for acknowledgements.


udpclient.cpp file is the sender
udpserver.cpp is the reciever.

use make to generate the executables. run using ./sender and ./reciever with the appropriate options.

Summary of Command Line Options: The command line options provided to the sender are listed below:
• -d – Turn ON Debug Mode (OFF if -d flag not present)
• -s string – Receiver Name or IP address.
• -p integer – Receiver’s Port Number
• -n integer – Sequence Number Field Length (in bits)
• -L integer – MAX_PACKET_LENGTH, in bytes
• -R integer – PACKET_GEN_RATE, in packets per second
• -N integer – MAX_PACKETS
• -W integer – WINDOW_SIZE (Assume that SWS = RWS)
• -B integer – BUFFER_SIZE

Summary of Command Line Options: The command line options provided to the receiver are listed below:
• -d – Turn ON Debug Mode (OFF if -d flag not present)
• -p integer – Receiver’s Port Number
• -N integer – MAX_PACKETS
• -n integer – Sequence Number Field Length (in bits)
• -W integer – WINDOW_SIZE (SWS = RWS)
• -B integer – BUFFER_SIZE
• -e double – PACKET_ERROR_RATE
